## Specs

### Game Mechanics

  Colored marbles should be able to be moved between the board's dots.

- Winning
  Upon a player moving all their marbles home, a screen should be shown allowing:
  1. Good Game (shows a woohoo screen, game over)
  2. Play for Second (winner dropped out, game continues)
  3. Yea, right (reverts the winning move, game continues)

  Keep track when a player moves and pass the turn
